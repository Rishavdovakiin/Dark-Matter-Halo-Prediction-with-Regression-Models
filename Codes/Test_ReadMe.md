# README for test.py
## Overview
This script, test.py, processes test data, loads a pre-trained model along with a preprocessing pipeline, makes predictions on dark matter halo concentration, and outputs the results. It also provides a visualization by plotting predicted values against actual labels, calculates the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) score, and saves the predictions to a CSV file.

## Requirements
### Python Libraries
To run the script, you need the following Python libraries:

```numpy```
```pandas```
```joblib```
```matplotlib```
```sklearn```
```dill```
You can install these using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas joblib matplotlib scikit-learn dill
```
